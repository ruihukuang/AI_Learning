### lab 2  
Context  
Use gpt-4o-mini to come up a question to evalute intelligence of a number of LLMs. Answers are provided by gpt-4o-mini,claude-3-7-sonnet-latest, gemini-2.0-flash,deepseek-chat and llama-3.3-70b-versatile . Then provide the question,responses from these LLMs without specifying model names and context for a model o3-mini acting as a judge to rank these models based on clarity and strength of argument related to responses.

### lab 3  
Context  
I have my linkin profile pdf and a summary text file about myself. Use gpt-4o-mini for my chat box. This chat box is to act as me and answer questions on my local website. The questions are  related to Janice's career, background, skills and experience. If it doesn't know the answer, it could not answer. Then use gemini-2.0-flash to evaluate the answers from gpt-4o-mini and if the answers are acceptable, they will be shown in the chat box with updated version.
